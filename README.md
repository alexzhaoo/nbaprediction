## Project Description

This project, titled **NBA Rookie to All-Star Classifier**, aims to predict whether a rookie NBA player will become an all-star based on their first or second season statistics. Utilizing an artificial perceptron for binary classification, the model leverages linear algebra techniques to update weight vectors iteratively during training. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set, enhancing computational efficiency and model performance. The final weight vectors, representing the trained model, are saved for future predictions, allowing the classifier to be reused without retraining. This approach ensures a streamlined and effective prediction pipeline, highlighting the intersection of machine learning and sports analytics.

## Customizing the Model

Users can easily download the code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexzhaoo/nbaprediction) and experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the model's accuracy. To change the maximum iterations and the learning rate (`eta`), users can modify the `imax` and `eta` parameters within the `perceptronLearningRule` function. For instance, in the provided code, `imax` is set to 15,000 and `eta` is set to 0.001 by default. Users can adjust these values to see how increasing or decreasing the number of iterations or the learning rate impacts the performance and accuracy of the classifier. By experimenting with these parameters, users can gain a deeper understanding of how the perceptron algorithm converges and how sensitive it is to these hyperparameters.
